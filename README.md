            Circle Game
Instructions:  When you are asked for your name you tap the end of the box that says replace me.
Delete the text and enter your own name. Press submit. The goal of the game is to get as big as possible by absorbing 
balls smaller than you. You will want to doge balls that are bigger. Your growth is slow and your score is displayed in the top right corner.
You can go off screen but beware there are still balls. If you die and wish to restart then you can press 'R'.
